# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting stock prices** using **machine learning techniques**. The goal is to analyze historical stock market data and build a predictive model that can estimate future stock prices based on past trends.

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to market volatility, noise, and external factors. This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML models can be combined to make meaningful predictions.
